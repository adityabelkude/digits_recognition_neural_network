Handwritten Digits Classification Using Neural Network
In this project, I developed a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
Initially, a simple model with only input and output layers was created, followed by adding a hidden layer to improve performance.
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, showcasing improvements in accuracy with a more complex network architecture. 
  A confusion matrix and heatmap visualization are also provided to illustrate the model's performance.
